        <p2>Interesting facts about me:
            Keeping active refresh my mind and distress me a little. Iceland is the country which enlightened me that the world out there is amazing.
            We must really travel and experience it ourselves. I like finding out the reason or logic behind things, I believe this trait is why I come to like coding.
            Whenever I face issue in coding, the process of finding different ways to achieve the solution is like solving puzzle to me. I really enjoyed it =D.
